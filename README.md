# RESUME

Code Institute - Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project.

I wanted to create a resume page that shows that i can use javascript mixed with html css.
I also wanted to show that i have grown and improved from the last project i did.

I wanted to create a website i can keep improving over a long period of time.
The resume websites target market would be for companies, recruitment agencies and my network.
I will make this website live to showcase my skills to the public and also learn from criticism and then improve on them.




# UX
 
This is my portfolio in terms of where i am today with my development course and what i have learned so far.
This website applies companies whom wish to hire me, and everyone else who wants to know where i am professionally.

For example: 
* The website showcases my skills and what i am capable of doing. 
* The website offers infomation about when i would finish my course at code institute.
* The website offers details about me.



# Strategy 

My goal with this website was to create my online Resume. To showcase my skills and to create a countdown clock,
that represents when i would be done with my course all together.
This was many people companies and friends and family andmy networks can know when i will be done with my course.
Is also a great way for companies to download my CV and see what i have build.
